----------- Important features: -------------- 

Hashing/salt for passwords: 
--PBDKF 2:
  --In cryptography, PBKDF1 and PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 1 and 2) are key derivation functions with a    sliding computational cost, used to reduce vulnerability to brute-force attacks. -- Wikipedia
  -- So it uses PBKDF2, which is an algorithm that just uses SHA256 along with a 128 bit salt, some key, and does it 10000 iterations. Does that sound like enough to explain it to him if he asks

password rules: 
-- A password must have the following: non alphanumeric characters, lowercase and uppercase characters, digits, a required length of at least 8 characters, and at least 1 unique character. (Look in Program.cs lines 22 - 28).

login rules/time
-- A lockout is started if the user cannot login in an account in, at max, 5 attempts. Once the number of attempts has maxed out, a lockout of 5 minutes is started. This lockout can be applied to new users. (Look in Program.cs lines 31-33 / Enabled in Login.cshtml.cs on line 114)

cookie details: 
-- Cookies are only accessible in the http requests, so client side scripts can't access them
-- Cookies have an expiration date of 5 minutes to help protect against session hijacking

basic attack proofs: 
-- brute force 
-- url traversal
